# Sticker Gallery

Sticker Gallery is a modern web app that lets users browse, search, and copy PNG stickers from local folders with a stylish, responsive gallery interface.

## How It Works

- **Browse Stickers:** Open `sticker.html` in your browser and click "Select Sticker Folder" to choose a directory containing PNG stickers. Stickers organized in subfolders are sorted by category.
- **Search & Filter:** Easily filter stickers by name using the search bar, or by category using the category options.
- **Copy Stickers:** Click any sticker to copy it as an image. (Works with Chromium-based browsers.)
- **Add More Stickers:** Add new PNG stickers to your folder/subfolders at any time—just refresh/reselect the folder in the app to see them.
